=== Deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP as your storage platform

BlueXP edge caching supports Cloud Volumes ONTAP deployed in Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. For detailed prerequisites, requirements, and deployment instructions, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-deploying-otc-azure.html[Launching Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure^], https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-deploying-otc-aws.html[Launching Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS^], or https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-deploying-gcp.html[Launching Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Google Cloud^]

Note the following additional BlueXP edge caching requirement:

* You should configure SMB file shares on the instance of Cloud Volumes ONTAP.
+
If no SMB file shares are set up on the instance, then you are prompted to configure the SMB shares during the installation of the BlueXP edge caching components.

=== Enable BlueXP edge caching in your working environment

The installation wizard walks you through the steps to deploy the BlueXP edge caching Management Server instance and the BlueXP edge caching Core instance, as highlighted below.

The Dashboard shows that the Management Server instance and the Core instance are both *On* and working.

=== License your BlueXP edge caching installation

Before you can use BlueXP edge caching, you need to configure the BlueXP edge caching License Management Server (LMS) service on a BlueXP edge caching Core instance. You will need your NSS Credentials or a Customer ID and Subscription Number provided NetApp to activate your subscription.

In this example, we will configure the LMS service on a Core instance that you just deployed in the public cloud. This is a one-time process that sets up your LMS service.

.Steps

. Open the Global File Cache License Registration page on the BlueXP edge caching Core (the Core you are designating as your LMS service) using the following URL. Replace _<ip_address>_ with the IP address of the BlueXP edge caching Core:
https://<ip_address>/lms/api/v1/config/lmsconfig.html

. Click *“Continue to this website (not recommended)”* to continue. A page that allows you to configure the LMS, or check existing license information, is displayed.
+
image:screenshot_gfc_license1.png[A screenshot of the BlueXP edge caching License Registration page.]

. Choose the mode of registration:
* “NetApp LMS” is used for customers who have purchased NetApp BlueXP edge caching Edge licenses from NetApp or its certified partners. (Preferred)
* “Legacy LMS” is used for existing or trial customers who have received a Customer ID through NetApp Support. (This option has been deprecated.)
//
// . For Legacy MS, click *Legacy MS*, enter your NSS Credentials, and click *Submit*.
// +
// image:screenshot_gfc_license3.png[A screenshot of entering a Legacy MS NSS Credentials in the BlueXP edge caching License Registration page.]

. For this example, click *NetApp LMS*, enter your Customer ID (preferably your email address), and click *Register LMS*.
+
image:screenshot_gfc_license2.png[A screenshot of entering an On-Premise LMS Customer ID in the BlueXP edge caching License Registration page.]

. Check for a confirmation email from NetApp that includes your GFC Software Subscription Number and Serial Number.
+
image:screenshot_gfc_license_email.png[A screenshot of the email from NetApp that contains your GFC Software Subscription Number.]

. Click the *NetApp LMS Settings* tab.

. Select *GFC License Subscription*, enter your GFC Software Subscription Number, and click *Submit*.
+
image:screenshot_gfc_license_subscription.png[A screenshot of entering your GFC Software Subscription Number in the GFC License Subscription page.]
+
You will see a message that your GFC License Subscription was registered successfully and activated for the LMS instance. Any subsequent purchases will automatically be added to the GFC License Subscription.

. Optionally, you can click the *License Information* tab to view all your GFC license information.

.What's Next?

If you have determined that you need to deploy multiple BlueXP edge caching Cores to support your configuration, click *Add Core Instance* from the Dashboard and follow the deployment wizard.

After you have completed your Core deployment, you need to link:download-gfc-resources.html[deploy the BlueXP edge caching Edge instances^] in each of your remote offices.

== Deploy additional Core instances

If your configuration requires more than one BlueXP edge caching Core to be installed because of a large number of Edge instances, you can add another Core to the working environment.

When deploying Edge instances, you will configure some to connect to the first Core and others to the second Core. Both Core instances access the same backend storage (your Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance) in the working environment.

. From the Global File Cache Dashboard, click *Add Core Instance*.
+
image:screenshot_gfc_add_another_core.png[A screenshot of the GFC Dashboard and the button to add an additional Core instance.]

. Enter the admin user credentials to join the Active Directory domain, and the service account user credentials. Then click *Continue*.
+
* The BlueXP edge caching Core instance must be in the same Active Directory domain as the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance.
* The service account is a domain user and it is part of the BUILTIN\Backup Operators group on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance.
+
image:screenshot_gfc_install6.png[A screenshot showing the configuration information necessary to set up the BlueXP edge caching Core active directory and service account.]

. Enter the admin credentials you will use to access to the BlueXP edge caching Core VM and click *Deploy GFC Core*. For Azure and Google Cloud you enter the credentials as a user name and password; for AWS you select the appropriate key pair. You can change the VM name if you want.
+
image:screenshot_gfc_install7.png[A screenshot showing the configuration information necessary to set up the BlueXP edge caching Core instance.]

. After the BlueXP edge caching Core is successfully deployed, click *Go to Dashboard*.
