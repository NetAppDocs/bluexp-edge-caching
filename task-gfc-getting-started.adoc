You deploy the BlueXP edge caching Management Server and Core software on one of your storage systems.

====
IMPORTANT

Starting in May 2024 the ability to enable, deploy, and manage Global File Cache components from the BlueXP user interface has been removed. You must perform these steps by accessing the storage system.

====

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details:

[role="quick-margin-para"]
BlueXP edge caching cloud configurations are supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP, Azure NetApp Files, Amazon FSx for ONTAP systems, and Cloud Volumes Service on Google Cloud. On-premises solutions are also available on NetApp AFF and FAS platforms. After you deploy your storage system, configure SMB file shares.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
See link:task-deploy-gfc-edge-instances.html[Deploying BlueXP edge caching Edge instances^] to deploy the BlueXP edge caching Edge instances in each remote location.

=== Deploy your storage platform

BlueXP edge caching cloud configurations are supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP (on AWS, Azure, and Google), Azure NetApp Files, Amazon FSx for ONTAP systems, and Cloud Volumes Service on Google Cloud. On-premises solutions are also available on NetApp AFF and FAS platforms.

Note the following additional BlueXP edge caching requirement:

* You should configure SMB file shares on the storage system.
+
If no SMB file shares are set up on the instance, then you are prompted to configure the SMB shares during the installation of the BlueXP edge caching components.

=== Deploy the Global File Cache Core

See Chapter 7 in the https://repo.cloudsync.netapp.com/gfc/Global%20File%20Cache%202.3.0%20User%20Guide.pdf[NetApp Global File Cache User Guide^].

=== License your BlueXP edge caching installation

Before you can use BlueXP edge caching, you need to configure the BlueXP edge caching License Management Server (LMS) service on a BlueXP edge caching Core instance. You will need your NSS Credentials or a Customer ID and Subscription Number provided NetApp to activate your subscription.

In this example, we will configure the LMS service on a Core instance that you just deployed in the public cloud. This is a one-time process that sets up your LMS service.

.Steps

. Open the Global File Cache License Registration page on the BlueXP edge caching Core (the Core you are designating as your LMS service) using the following URL. Replace _<ip_address>_ with the IP address of the BlueXP edge caching Core:
https://<ip_address>/lms/api/v1/config/lmsconfig.html

. Click *“Continue to this website (not recommended)”* to continue. A page that allows you to configure the LMS, or check existing license information, is displayed.
+

. Choose the mode of registration:
* “NetApp LMS” is used for customers who have purchased NetApp BlueXP edge caching Edge licenses from NetApp or its certified partners. (Preferred)
* “Legacy LMS” is used for existing or trial customers who have received a Customer ID through NetApp Support. (This option has been deprecated.)

. For this example, click *NetApp LMS*, enter your Customer ID (preferably your email address), and click *Register LMS*.

. Check for a confirmation email from NetApp that includes your GFC Software Subscription Number and Serial Number.
+

. Click the *NetApp LMS Settings* tab.

. Select *GFC License Subscription*, enter your GFC Software Subscription Number, and click *Submit*.
+

+
You will see a message that your GFC License Subscription was registered successfully and activated for the LMS instance. Any subsequent purchases will automatically be added to the GFC License Subscription.

. Optionally, you can click the *License Information* tab to view all your GFC license information.

.What's Next?

If you have determined that you need to deploy multiple BlueXP edge caching Cores to support your configuration, click *Add Core Instance* from the Dashboard and follow the deployment wizard.

After you have completed your Core deployment, you need to link:download-gfc-resources.html[deploy the BlueXP edge caching Edge instances^] in each of your remote offices.
